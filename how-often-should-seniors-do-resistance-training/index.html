As we age, our muscles naturally lose strength and mass, leading to a higher risk of falls and injuries. Resistance training can help combat this by building muscle, increasing bone density, and improving overall strength and mobility. However, it's essential to know how often to do resistance training to ensure you're getting the most out of your workouts without overexerting yourself. In this article, we'll go over how often seniors should do resistance training, how to incorporate it into your routine, and some tips for getting started.</p><h2>How to Incorporate Resistance Training into Your Routine</h2><p>The first step in incorporating resistance training into your routine is to consult with your doctor or a qualified fitness professional to ensure you're healthy enough to start a resistance training program. They'll be able to assess your current fitness level and recommend exercises that are safe and appropriate for your individual needs.</p><p>Once you've received clearance from your doctor or fitness professional, it's time to start incorporating resistance training into your routine. Aim for at least two resistance training sessions per week, with a minimum of 48 hours of rest between sessions.

Gradually increase the weight as your strength improves.</li><li>Incorporate variety: Mix up your exercises to keep your workouts interesting and challenging.
