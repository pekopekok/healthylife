Wear comfortable clothing that is easy to move in, and avoid heavy meals before class.</p><p>Once you arrive at class, find a spot near the front of the room where you can see and hear the instructor. The class will typically begin with some warm-up poses to get your body prepared for the heat. You will then move through a series of poses, or asanas, that are designed to stretch and strengthen your body. The instructor will guide you through each pose, and it is important to listen carefully to their instructions.</p><p>Throughout the class, you will be encouraged to take breaks and drink water as needed.
