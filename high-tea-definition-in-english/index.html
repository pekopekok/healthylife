High tea is usually served between 3 pm and 5 pm and is often enjoyed by groups of friends or family members.</p><h2>How Did High Tea Originate?</h2><p>The origin of high tea can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution in England. During this time, the working class would return home from work around 6 pm and have a meal that consisted of bread, butter, cheese, and tea. This meal was known as "high tea" because it was served at a high table or dining table. The upper class, on the other hand, would have a lighter meal in the afternoon, which included tea and small cakes or sandwiches. This meal was known as "low tea" because it was served on a low table or coffee table. Over time, the two meals became combined, and high tea became a more formal affair.</p><h2>What Can You Expect from a High Tea Experience?</h2><p>When you attend a high tea, you can expect to be served a variety of tea sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and jam, cakes, and pastries.
