This can lead to overuse injuries such as sprains, strains, and tendinitis.</p><h3>Less Intense Workouts</h3><p>When you break up your workouts throughout the day, you may not be able to push yourself as hard during each individual workout.

This can include activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, weightlifting, and yoga.</p><h3>Take Breaks</h3><p>Make sure to take breaks between your workout sessions to allow your body to rest and recover.
