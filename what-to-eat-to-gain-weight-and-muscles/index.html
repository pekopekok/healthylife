While exercise is important for building muscles, nutrition is the foundation for muscle growth. You need to consume more calories than you burn to gain weight, but not all calories are created equal. Eating unhealthy foods high in saturated fats and sugar will only lead to fat gain, not muscle growth. </p><p>Instead, focus on consuming nutrient-dense foods that are high in protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. These foods will provide your body with the energy and nutrients it needs to build muscles. </p><h2 id="what-to-eat">What to Eat to Gain Weight and Muscles</h2><p>When it comes to building muscles, protein is the most important nutrient.
