This will help you plan your schedule and manage your time effectively. In this blog post, we’ll take a closer look at the daily school routine in India, including what time school starts and ends, what subjects are taught, and what extracurricular activities you can expect to participate in.</p><h2>What is the Typical School Schedule in India?</h2><p>Most schools in India start between 7:30 and 8:30 am and end between 1:30 and 2:30 pm. However, this can vary depending on the school, with some starting earlier and others ending later. Typically, students attend school for five to six hours a day, with a short break in the middle for lunch.</p><h3>What Subjects are Taught in Indian Schools?</h3><p>The subjects taught in Indian schools include English, Hindi, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and a second language (often regional). In addition to these core subjects, students may also take classes in Art, Music, Physical Education, and Computer Science.</p><h3>What Extracurricular Activities are Available?</h3><p>Extracurricular activities are an important part of the school experience in India. These can include sports, debate clubs, drama clubs, music clubs, and more.

This is a time for students to gather and listen to announcements, sing the national anthem, and recite a prayer.</p><h3>Step 3: Attending Classes</h3><p>After the morning assembly, students attend their first class of the day. They will typically have five to six classes in total, with each class lasting between 45 minutes to an hour. There is usually a short break in between classes for students to use the restroom, get a snack, or socialize with classmates.</p><h3>Step 4: Lunch Break</h3><p>Most schools in India have a lunch break of around 30 minutes to an hour. Students can bring their own lunch or purchase food from the school canteen. During this time, students can also participate in extracurricular activities or use the time to study.</p><h3>Step 5: Afternoon Classes</h3><p>After the lunch break, students attend their afternoon classes. These may be the same subjects as the morning classes or different ones. The classes usually end by 1:30 or 2:30 pm, depending on the school.</p><h3>Step 6: Participating in Extracurricular Activities</h3><p>After classes are over, students may participate in extracurricular activities or attend after-school tutoring sessions.
